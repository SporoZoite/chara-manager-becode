# Character manager

## This project was realized by:
Lisa van Hooydonk: https://github.com/SporoZoite
Eva Mélinand: https://github.com/Evamel

## When and why this project?
BECODE's exercice :
In August 2021, a comics fan contacted us because he needed a **dashboard to manage his favorite characters.**
For this work, we have to respect the designer's mock-up.

## What?
The aim of this app is to manage the characters. For that, you can:
* See the existing characters (image and short description).
* Display an image, the short description and the description of one character.
* Delete or update your characters.
* Search one character with the search bar.
* Format the texts with the Markdown editor.

### You can see the app with this link :
